# CanditoWorkout

To-Do

-Stopper actually counts down from certain time and alerts the user when time is up

-Stopper is separate fragment and also appears in notifications

-Exists a motivational function in where it takes in your BodyMassIndex and based on that popups like "my grandma has bigger biceps" or "your lifts are worse than a 3 legged dogs" appear

-Fix bugs a la if you enter over 1k in max reps, it stops saveing and crashes, when choosing optional arm exes, if first is "none" then second won't count anyways.

-Add graph view to show progress

-Fix opening menu design where it shows bubbles on the finish button
