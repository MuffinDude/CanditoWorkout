# CanditoWorkout

## To-Do

1.Stopper actually counts down from certain time and alerts the user when time is up
2.Sopper is separate fragment and also appears in notifications
3.Exists a motivational function in where it takes in your BodyMassIndex and based on that popups like "my grandma has bigger biceps" or "your lifts are worse than a 3 legged dogs" appear
4.Fix bugs a la if you enter over 1k in max reps, it stops saveing and crashes, when choosing optional arm exes, if first is "none" then second won't count anyways.
5.Add graph view to show progress
6.Fix opening menu design where it shows bubbles on the finish button

## Problems
1. Android 4.4 will crash when completing a set and pressing on a button to change the color. Says something about it being void.
